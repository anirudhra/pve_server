# Home Assistant device config backup/restore script
# Primary usage is to restore device config after a router reboot that messes up iot network IPs
# Usage:
# 1) Put this on homeassistant VM's /root directory and call it once every day with 'crontab -e':
#      @daily  ./devicebackuprestore.sh /homeassistant/.storage/core.config_entries backup
# 2) Put another instance in crontab -e for the restore to run a few minutes after the router reboots
#      <frequency> ./devicebackuprestore.sh /homeassistant/.storage/core.config_entries restore
# This script copies a file to a backup location or restores it from backup.
# It requires exactly two arguments: the source file and either "backup" or "restore".
