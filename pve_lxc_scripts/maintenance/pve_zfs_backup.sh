# Before backing up mount external USB ZFS with zfs_mount.sh script and after
# backup, unmount the ZFS fs and export the pool cleanly with zfs_umount.sh script before
# disconnecting to avoid data loss

# mv /hdpool/fs/log/server_backup.log /hdpool/fs/log/server_backup_prev.log
#
# add all exclusion directories to the _exclude external file below, all output logged to file
